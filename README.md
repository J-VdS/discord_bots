# discord_bots (PYTHON)
#### Python version 3.6 and higher

## used lib
  * discord.py (not the rewrite)
    https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

### Bots I made and some explanation
  * indielm_bot.py:
    -> If somebody wrote a message containing 'router' or 'splitter' the bot reacts with a 'router' emoji.
    -> The server owner can use the !clean command to delete some messages in a channel.
       To add this you will need to add your name + id on the second line of the token.txt file.
       
##### Ps: You will need to add token.txt in the same directory as your bot. The firs line needs to contain your TOKEN
